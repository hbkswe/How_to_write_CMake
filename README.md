#How to write CMake
Hi, this is my personal tutorial while I am teaching myself how to use CMake 2 and CMake 3, or you can say traditional CMake and modern CMake.

I used to code Makefile for all the projects I participated in. The whole Makefile(s) works as expected but it takes more and more time to modify the files with the expansion of the projects. So, the migration to CMake is reasonable while it has better support for the scalability of the projects.

I also have a tutorial that goes with the source code in my personal blog to help me quickly review the things that I have learnt and forget (quite often!).
