#How to write CMake
Hi, this is my personal tutorial while I am learning how to use CMake 2 and CMake 3

I used to code Makefile for all the projects I participated in. The whole Makefile(s) works as expected but it takes more and more time to modify the files with the expansion of the projects. So, the migration to CMake is reasonable while it has better support for the scalability.

Included here are 5 simple projects to explain how CMake is coded to:
- Just compile a project with a "Hello World" program
- Seperate build and source code
- Build a static (archived) library
- Build a dynamic (shared) linrary
- Include library to project
- A look at modern CMake (CMake 3)

The tutorial that goes with the source code in [my personal Blog](https://hieubkhcm.github.io/cmake_01_hello_world/) to help quickly review the things that I have learnt.
